## Personal Projects website

This is a website that allows its users to create new projects to keep track of. It will contain tailwind css as well as other react essentials such as components, refs, portals, states and more. All the work that is done here is me documenting my progress in the udemy course "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)"
